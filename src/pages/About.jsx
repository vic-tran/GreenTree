              Greentree is the only neighborhood with a HOA within the North El
              Camino project area. The Greentree HOA is a resident group that
              maintains the unnamed private park within the area. Irvine was
              designed as a series of “villages” with each village separated by
              six-lane streets and containing residential areas, commercial
              centers, schools, religious institutions, and open spaces. Irvine
              was envisioned as a community that would allow residents an easy
              and comfortable lifestyle, and included design elements such as
              cul-de-sacs, parks, and greenbelts.
